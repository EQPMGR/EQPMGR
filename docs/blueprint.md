# **App Name**: EQPMGR

## Core Features:

- Data Import: Import workout data automatically from connected apps such as Strava to track equipment usage.
- Wear Simulation: Use machine learning algorithms as a tool to simulate wear and tear on digital twins of sports equipment based on usage data.
- Wear Visualization: Visually represent the wear and tear status of each component with color-coded indicators and a health percentage.
- Schedule Generation: Generate maintenance schedules based on wear simulation and manufacturer guidelines.
- Maintenance Alerts: Alert users when equipment requires maintenance based on simulation results and mileage
- Maintenance Logging: Allow users to manually log maintenance events, modifications, and repairs for their equipment.
- Stats and Information Display: Provide an interface to display total KM, hours used and manufacturing details

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Use a desaturated teal (#2a5d59) from the original screenshot for the background to maintain a sense of calm and reliability, inspired by the muted tones of the photograph.
- Background color: Lighter desaturated teal (#6ec8bf) for card backgrounds, for soft contrast and to reinforce a muted, modern aesthetic.
- Accent color: Burnt orange (#D98945), taken from the Strava logo in the original screenshot, used sparingly for interactive elements and key alerts to draw the user's eye.
- Headline font: 'Monteserrat', sans-serif, to convey a modern, technical, precise feeling, and also to match the original screenshot. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Body font: 'Inter', sans-serif, is added as companion font to provide highly readable paragraphs of supporting text. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use outline-style icons for equipment components, similar to those in the reference image. Use the accent color to highlight wear and tear.
- Adopt a card-based layout to display equipment status, maintenance schedules, and usage statistics.
